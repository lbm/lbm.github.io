Hey there, I'm Lachlan.

I secure and develop applications at [ExaWizards Inc.][exawizards], a Tokyo-based software firm focused on solving social issues with artificial intelligence. I'm principally responsible for managing our cloud infrastructure and ensuring its security. The projects I've been involved in span across a large variety of sectors including finance, healthcare, and robotics.

Previously, I worked as a machine learning engineer for the [University of Adelaide][uoa]. Before that, I created government and enterprise mobile applications at [Appvation][appvation]. I'm particularly skilled in full-stack platform development, cloud infrastructure management, and security engineering.
